The player is required 
to select a monster and solve the math equation associated with that monster. 
As the current app is mainly focused on task-centered design, we aimed to give 
more priority to user-centered design, where the user’s preferences and needs are 
taken into account. This was achieved by improving the overall hierarchy and navigation 
of the app. We have incorporated login/signup screens to allow users to create their 
own profiles and have a more personalized experience. This was accompanied by a profile 
screen that had the user’s name and all stats related to their progress in the game. 
In addition, we’ve added a main menu screen that offers various options for the user 
to navigate to different parts of the game including, a settings screen, a user profile 
screen, a skills tree page, an exit button, and the play button. Furthermore, 
we’ve included a skills tree functionality that allows the user to unlock new abilities 
as they progress through the game. To make the game more engaging, a game info screen was 
incorporated where users can select different maps to play on, as well as choosing different 
difficulty levels. Finally, the gameplay experience was enhanced by employing the WASD keys 
for switching between monsters to optimize user focus.</p><hr/><h2 id="navigation-map-of-the-system">Navigation map of the system</h2><h4 id="1.-after-you-start-the-game,-you-will-log-in-with-your-account-first.-our-preset-game-user-name-and-password-are-admin-and-admin123-respectively.-after-successful-login,-the-game-will-enter-the-start-screen.">1<!-- -->.

This is shown by the use of buttons throughout the game, which have the affordance to be pressed. In addition, when the user hovers over the buttons, the applied transition effects provide the user with visual feedback that implies the buttons can be clicked, thereby suggesting their functionality. In addition to the fact that each button affords its functionality; a pause button pauses the game, a home button goes to the home page, and so on. Another example of affordance is dropdown menus such as the difficulty levels dropdown menu which has a downward arrow affording a list of options.</blockquote><h3 id="2.consistency:">2<!-- -->.Consistency:</h3><blockquote>Consistency is utilized where all pages<!-- -->/screens of the game have a common aesthetic and function. This was assured by using the same design elements, colors, and placement of things throughout the game. Buttons are consistently used throughout the game as a means of navigation, with the same color and design allowing the user to easily navigate through the game. Furthermore, dropdown menus are used consistently within the game as a way to present the user with options they can select from.</blockquote><h3 id="3.progressive-disclosure:">3<!-- -->.Progressive disclosure:</h3><blockquote>Progressive disclosure is used in our design to avoid overwhelming the user with too much information at once. This was done by gradually revealing the game’s features to the user as they progress through the pages. For example, the user is first presented with the instructions page, then a main menu where they have the option to go to a profile page, or a skills tree page, and so on.</blockquote><h3 id="4.visibility:">4<!-- -->.Visibility:</h3><blockquote>Visibility is employed where all necessary tools and information remain available to the user while they’re playing. For instance, the user’s score, health, time left, and skills are shown to the user while playing without the need to search for them and without the need to memorize where things are. In addition, the design is made to avoid distracting the user with redundant information.</blockquote><h3 id="5.chunking:">5<!-- -->.Chunking:</h3><blockquote>Chunking is applied by using dropdown menus to group similar functionalities. An instance of this is the grouping of the different difficulty levels, audio volume settings, and the different game modes under a single dropdown menu, while limiting the number of items displayed to a reasonable amount for a menu. Moreover, chunking was also applied by separating the different screens in the game based on functionality. For example, features related to gameplay options were grouped into the initial info game screen, while features related to settings and options were grouped into a main menu screen.</blockquote><h3 id="6.mapping:">6<!-- -->.Mapping:</h3><blockquote>The mapping principle was considered by adding the functionality of the ‘wasd’ keys to switch between monsters during the game. This change was made to address an issue of usability with the previous design, which required the user to switch between monsters using their mouse then use their keyboard to type their answer. By mapping the ‘wasd’ keys to monster selection, it is easier for the user to switch between monsters while playing the game without having to pause and disrupt their gameplay.</blockquote><h3 id="7.transfer-levels:">7<!-- -->.Transfer Levels:</h3><blockquote>The use of the ‘wasd’ keys for monster selection helps facilitate the transfer of learning for users, as these keys are commonly used for movement in many different games, therefore allowing for a positive transfer of previous knowledge. In addition, adding the skills feature encourages a positive transfer because it enables users to use the knowledge they have acquired from previous games that have utilized a skills tree, yet in a different context.</blockquote><h3 id="8.selective-attention:">8<!-- -->.Selective Attention:</h3><blockquote>The game employs the principle of selective attention by dividing its features into separate pages, enabling users to concentrate on distinct tasks in different contexts. In addition, when selecting a monster<!-- -->/equation to solve during gameplay, a red tag is added to the selected monster to ensure that the user’s attention is focused on that particular monster and not get confused with the other monsters.</blockquote><h3 id="9.confirmation:">9<!-- -->.Confirmation:</h3><blockquote>Confirmation is utilized in our game when the user pauses the game. When the user pauses the game, they are prompted with a window that allows them to choose between resuming the game, restarting the game, or going to the home page. This was not implemented in the original design of the game, which would just freeze the game upon pausing. In this case, the user has the freedom to choose and confirm their intentions for pausing.</blockquote><h3 id="10.feedback:">1<!-- -->0<!-- -->.Feedback:</h3><blockquote>Feedback is used throughout the game by providing the user with information about what action has been done. The application provides the user with feedback if they input a wrong username or password when logging in. This is done by displaying an error message and explaining what the error is. Feedback is also utilized with the use of buttons. If a user clicks on the pause button mid game, they are given a few options they can choose from - go to the home page, resume the game, or restart. This allows the user to understand what their actions have resulted into.</blockquote><h3 id="11.causality:">1<!-- -->1<!-- -->.Causality:</h3><blockquote>Causality plays a fundamental role in all of the game’s aspects by establishing a clear relationship between the player’s actions and the corresponding outcomes. This is evident in the game’s navigation where buttons trigger the expected effect and lead the user to the correct place. Additionally, during gameplay, the switching between the wasd keys causes a switch between different monsters, which matches the user’s expectations. Causality is also present in the skills tree where the selection of different abilities has an impact on their available options, and upgrades in the skills tree itself are reflected in the game screen.</blockquote><h3 id="12.control:">1<!-- -->2<!-- -->.Control:</h3><blockquote>In the game redesign, the control design principle is achieved through a variety of means, including allowing the user to control choosing from different maps for a more interactive experience, control difficulty levels, and select between different game modes, such as single player or multiplayer. Giving the user control over these aspects enables the user to tailor their experience to their own preferences and skill level.</blockquote><h3 id="13.hicks-law:">1<!-- -->3<!-- -->.Hicks Law:</h3><blockquote>Hicks law was applied in our game to minimize the choices a user has to make and this was done by making the game progression based. That was ensured by dividing the features across the game and not overwhelming the user with too many options to pick from at once. This is shown by the minimizing options for dropdowns, separating game’s skills<!-- -->/abilities from gameplay, and minimizing the selection of maps.</blockquote><h3 id="14.constraints:">1<!-- -->4<!-- -->.Constraints:</h3><blockquote>Gestalts laws of grouping have been implemented in the skills tree, which groups the various skills to make it easier for the user to understand the connections. For example, skills that are related are placed in close proximity to allow the user to easily see how the skills are related. In addition to using similar icons for the similar types of skills to better represent the relationship.</blockquote><h3 id="15.gestalts-laws-of-grouping:">1<!-- -->5<!-- -->.Gestalts laws of grouping:</h3><blockquote>Constraining the user input for login<!-- -->/signup prevents garbage output. Any incorrect username or password inputted by the user is detected and the user is then prompted to enter valid credentials. In addition, the proper use of affordances, constraints, and feedback throughout the game further minimizes the potential for garbage input.</blockquote><h3 id="16.externalization-of-information:">1<!-- -->6<!-- -->.Externalization of Information:</h3><blockquote>The created design balances between the internalization and externalization of information by internalizing only the most essential and intuitive groups such as buttons that allow the user to navigate to different pages. This approach avoids cluttering everything in one page and makes it easier for the user to find what they need, while externalizing more complex information such as presenting all user profile information in one page, all the different map options clear on the screen, and having buttons handy for users.</blockquote><h3 id="17.garbage-in---garbage-out:">1<!-- -->7<!-- -->.Garbage in - garbage out:</h3><blockquote>The skills tree contains <!-- -->3 <!-- -->distinct representations of possible skills that are purchasable. They are a stopwatch, a fast man running, and a heart symbol. Within the skill tree, the user’s task is to determine what kind of skill buff they would like to buy. The underlying issue with presenting information in a skill tree is a categorical one. The cognitive capabilities of the users are targeted towards teens<!-- -->/young adults; they should not suffer cognitive exhaustion when interpreting representations, but they would not prefer information overload (minimalism over pure info). The context of use of the representations is a game. With these points, the simplistic and common representations of a stopwatch denoting time, a fast man running denoting speed of the game, and the heart denoting the lives of the user are all good representations that only aid the user in interacting with these representations.</blockquote><h3 id="18.representation:">1<!-- -->8<!-- -->.Representation:</h3><blockquote>The use of pictorial representation of stopwatch, a fast man running, and a heart symbol in the skills tree can enhance the user’s ability to quickly understand the available options. Since deceptive representations are superior to memory, clearly representing these icons in the skills tree allows the user to easily recognize and remember what each one represents.</blockquote><h3 id="19.pictorial-superiority-effect:">1<!-- -->9<!-- -->.Pictorial Superiority Effect:</h3><blockquote>The game provides constraints to prevent users from making errors or taking actions that could lead to negative outcomes. In the skills tree, constraints are used to limit the user’s ability to purchase skills that may not be acceptable for their current level. Similarly, in the login process, constraints are used to prevent unauthorized access by not allowing incorrect usernames and<!-- -->/or passwords.</blockquote><h3 id="20.working-memory:">2<!-- -->0<!-- -->.Working Memory:</h3><blockquote>Working memory has been applied to our game by implementing design choices that reduce the cognitive load on the users. For example, each navigation page is self-contained and doesn’t require the user to remember information from previous pages. Important information such as the user’s score, health, and pause button are constantly present during gameplay, allowing the user to quickly access them without needing to rely on working memory.</blockquote><hr/><h2 id="heuristic-evaluation">Heuristic Evaluation</h2><blockquote>The main purpose of this project is to improve the user’s experience in the game (mathematical castle game) by quickly learning the rules of the game and successfully completing the whole game process. Therefore, team members were selected as the evaluation team for the system, and the evaluation was rotated within the team. To facilitate communication and documentation at evaluation period, records of all significant evaluation results produced at all stages of the design will be kept in online storage. In order to finally evaluate the system more accurately and effectively, use Nielsen Norman’s ten classical heuristic guidelines to evaluate the whole system. It involves evaluating the entire user experience process of the game, from the introduction of the game at the beginning of the interface to the statistics at the end of the game.</blockquote><p>The details are as follows:</p><h3 id="1.visibility-of-system-status:">1<!-- -->.Visibility of System Status:</h3><p>Included: Compared with the previous system, we have clearly highlighted the time display and the goal selection of the game, which makes the user clearly know the current state of their game.
Not Included: Further processing can be done during the rest time, as most users will probably not notice the progress for the rest of the time if they do not pay attention.</p><h3 id="2.match-between-the-system-and-the-real-world:">2<!-- -->.Match Between the System and the Real World:</h3><p>Included: The design language used in the system is familiar and consistent with the user’s mental models. User’s are exposed to the same movement method in many other games (using wasd keys), users have experience with the usage of a skills tree in other game contexts. 
Not Included:  The content of the user profile can be further improved by adding more information and features such as rewards and achievements to match a real-world expectation of a profile screen.</p><h3 id="3.user-control-&amp;-freedom:">3<!-- -->.User Control &amp; Freedom:</h3><p>Included: The game gives the user control and freedom to perform the different tasks. They can freely switch and navigate between the screens at their discretion, in addition to having control over pausing the game and going back to the home page to make other decisions.Not Included:  It will be helpful to allow users to adjust some parameters during the game and show more details in the form of small windows, such as personal skills, which can allow users to quickly assess their current progress of the game.</p><h3 id="4.consistency-and-standards:">4<!-- -->.Consistency and Standards:</h3><p>Included:  The new game has incorporated consistent design elements, colors, button styles, and navigation design of all interfaces, which makes users more familiar with the operation of each function and improves the learnability of the different tasks.
Not Included:  A consistent style can also make users bored in the long run, and so adding more customizable and distinct features to the game style can improve this.</p><h3 id="5.error-prevention:">5<!-- -->.Error Prevention:</h3><p>Included: In contrast to the previous design, where pausing the game would redirect the user to the homepage, the new system now includes a small window that integrates home, restart, and resume options, to avoid misleading affordance and potential errors. Error prevention was also tackled by providing an error message whenever a user inputs wrong username and/or password when logging in.
Not Included: In the case when a user mistakenly inputs a wrong answer for the math equations, it would be helpful to allow them to undo actions to prevent frustration and errors.</p><h3 id="6.recognition-vs.-recall-in-user-interfaces:">6<!-- -->.Recognition vs. Recall in User Interfaces:</h3><p>Included: In terms of button layout, the new system places all the back to upper action buttons in the lower right corner for each page, which saves users from having to remember the same action(back button, some button may have different location in other games)  in different locations due to different game pages.
Not Included: Most game interface Settings are placed in the game interface, so integrating Settings into the game interface can reduces the extra memory to set the game interface.</p><h3 id="7.flexibility-and-efficiency-of-use:">7<!-- -->.Flexibility and Efficiency of Use:</h3><p>Included: The original game only offered mouse-selected enemies, which was a usability and flexibility issue since it disrupted the gameplay. In the new game, the user can flexibly switch between monsters using the wasd keys and enter their answer using their keyboard. 
Not Included: Users may have different preferences for gameplay controls, offering options for both mouse and keyboard can increase the flexibility of the game. This can be done by adding a game control button to allow the user to choose between these options.</p><h3 id="8.aesthetic-and-minimalist-design:">8<!-- -->.Aesthetic and Minimalist Design:</h3><p>Included:The new system designs a unified and simple layout and style for the multiple interfaces. A common background is used across all pages, and all colors and items match together. In addition, adding a map selection for the game improves the game aesthetic.
Not Included: Add an interface with other functions besides the game interface to enhance the richness of the game, lest the user lose interest in the simplicity of the design.</p><h3 id="9.help-users-recognize,-diagnose-and-recover-from-errors:">9<!-- -->.Help Users Recognize, Diagnose and Recover from Errors:</h3><p>Included: Due to the low complexity of the game, the small window provided during the game pause stage can quickly identify the current game state for the user, so as not to stop the game incorrectly because the user stops the game without prompting.
Not Included:At the end of the game, users can be provided with wrong operations during the game, which can help users understand the wrong actions during the game operation and improve the game experience.</p><h3 id="10.help-&amp;-documentation:">1<!-- -->0<!-- -->.Help &amp; Documentation:</h3><p>Included: Compared to the short and inconspicuous instructions of the original game, the new system deliberately displays the operation instructions of the game in the form of pictures and text behind the main page, which allows users to learn the rules of the game in a reasonable and quick way.
Not Included: More instructions can be provided on the functional interface in addition to the basic operation of the game, so that the user can understand the details of each game function.</p><hr/><h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2><p>Although we have made many detailed improvements to the features of the original game and improved the gameplay experience, there are still many areas that need to be improved based on design principles.
Highlighting or sounding the remaining time while the game is in progress gives the user better visibility into the system.
In the user profile section, users can be provided with relevant unlock features (for example, unlock more detailed user statistics and rankings, etc.), which can be obtained based on the user’s playing time or experience points.
Extra buttons for parameter Settings in the game interface, so users can avoid having to quit the game multiple times and adjust the parameters.
In the interface style, can provide a variety of color choice and customizable features to enhance the interactivity and aesthetic of the design.
For the frequent hidden menu action key, we can set a most frequently used key in the user frequently used interface.
We can set the game keys to decide whether to use the mouse, keyboard or all.
Additional features include the ability to set up a small online chat room for players to communicate with each other.
At the end of the game summary interface, users can also be provided with additional misoperation statistics, so as to improve user summary experience and improve game performance.
Additional instructions and visual cues can be added within the game screen to further aid the user while playing.</p><hr/><h2 id="learn-more">Learn More</h2><p>To learn more, see our project on <a href="https://github.com/uwohci23/Group4">GitHub</a>.</p><hr/></div></div></div></div>
